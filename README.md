## Basic References
The purpose of this repo is to serve as a "depot" for sample codes specifically in ES6, from algorithm samples to small utilities I found useful in day to day job.

This repo is to serve my own self leaning, both in learning codes and learning to "teach to code (in ES6)." Thus this should serve those who have same interests.

The utility codes are also to serve basic examples to tackle day to day coding / web development jobs. (And for me to look no further) They are the codes I found useful and used more than once.
